# Flow Lab
Train your flow

Flow Lab is a timer specialized for practicing flow art.

The timer allows you to set how long you would like to flow for, as well as the different modes or styles of movement you would like to practice in your flow session, and how long you would like to spend on each style at a time.

A few default styles have been provided geared towards finger tutting or gloving, but any styles from any flow art can be added by the user to make a custom flow practice session.

## Set-up

`npm i` to install dependencies

`npm run server` to run webpack, sass, and start a server on `localhost:3000`
